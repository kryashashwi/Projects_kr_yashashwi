entity decoder is
port ( 
   X  : in std_logic_vector(2 downto 0);
   S : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0));
end entity;

architecture Formula of decoder is

begin

S(0)<= not(X(0)) and not(X(1)) and not(X(2));
S(1)<= not(X(0)) and not(X(1)) and X(2);
S(2)<= not(X(0)) and X(1) and not(X(2));
S(3)<=not(X(0)) and X(1) and (X(2));
S(4)<=(X(0)) and not(X(1)) and not(X(2));
S(5)<= (X(0)) and not(X(1)) and (X(2));
S(6)<= (X(0)) and (X(1)) and not(X(2));
S(7)<= (X(0)) and (X(1)) and (X(2));
end Formula;
